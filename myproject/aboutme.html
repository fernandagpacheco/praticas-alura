            <p>My name is Fernanda. I'm 36 years old and live in Porto Alegre, Brasil. I'm a
                pharmacist with a master's degree in pharmaceutical biotechnology. I've always been curious about
                technology.</p>
            <p>In my previous jobs, I often found myself solving issues related to tech. I
                didn't have to solve them, but
                since I didn't like relying on others and enjoyed this kind of challenge, I thought, why not?</p>
            <p>It turns out that now I've decided to dive deeper and learn more about it.
                That's why I've decided to share
                my project. This is me learning everything I can and, hopefully, working with it professionally in the
                future.
