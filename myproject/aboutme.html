        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Fernanda. I'm 36 years old and live in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I am a pharmacist with a master's degree in pharmaceutical biotechnology.I have always been curious about technology. In my previous jobs, I often found myself solving issues related to tech. I didn't have to solve them, but since I didn't like relying on others and enjoyed this kind of challenge, I thought, why not?
        It turns out that now I've decided to dive deeper and learn more about it. That's why I've decided to share my project. This is me learning everything I can and, hopefully, working with it professionally in the future.
